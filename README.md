# Chemically-Modified-DNA
In this project, we propose a machine learning-aided solid-state nanopore for the detection of both natural and chemically modified nucleotides, exploring a wide range of modifications in the nucleobase, sugar, and phosphate moieties. Using the signature graphene nanopore transmission readouts, we try to identify natural and a wide range of chemically modified nucleotides with good sensitivity and selectivity. To significantly reduce the time of nucleotide identification, we coupled the approach with explainable ML classification tools, which enabled the identification with good precision and accuracy. Integrating with the best-fitted model, the graphene nanopore achieves good classification accuracy of up to 96% for each natural, chemically modified, purine, and pyrimidine nucleotide.
